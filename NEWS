0.9 (2007-XX-XX)
================

- Added MockerTestCase.makeFile() and .makeDir() helpers.  They offer
  easy creation of temporary files/directories, and ensure that they
  get removed after each test method runs.

- If the replay() method is called twice, expectations will be fully
  reset so that several similar tests may be performed in a row by
  just calling replay() again.

- Mocker.on_restore() removed.  Restore isn't performed if replay()
  isn't called, and that may not be obvious, so a hook won't be
  exposed for now.

- When using an unexistent import path for Mocker.proxy(), raise an
  ImportError on the base module, rather than using the actual
  string as the object (#162315).
