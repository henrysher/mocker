0.9 (2007-XX-XX)
================

- Added MockerTestCase.makeFile() and .makeDir() helpers.  They offer
  easy creation of temporary files/directories with certainty of
  removal after tests finish running.

- Mocker.on_restore() removed.  Restore isn't performed if replay()
  isn't called, and that may not be obvious, so a hook won't be
  exposed for now.


0.8 (2007-11-11)
================

Released!
