History
=======

Mocker has been inherited from Gustavo Niemeyer. It has been originally been
developed with Bazaar on Launchpad.net. I've moved it to github hoping to
revive the project slightly.

TODO
====

 * Move all the old issues and shut down the launchpad.net/mocker bug tracker
 * Convert http://labix.org/mocker to github pages
